# CAN_BUS
CRISS Robotics Can bus codes

This is the update of the CAN BUS project going on. You can find thee codes starting from basic function of sending integers,
to sending any number of inputs in the Can bus, and also performed succesful transfer of long integers.

We tried tinkering with varioud speed we found that speeds upto 500 kbps work it seems to not send or atleast there is nothing
visible at the receive side when ran at 1000 kbps.
